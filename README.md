# Arcade Shooter 
The proposal is to create a simple arcade game derivative of Space Invaders or Galaga.
## Summary
The game will be a round of defense against randomly generated enemies, with basic rules and a general strategy. The objective of the game is to eliminate the number of enemies while making use of your trusty trigger finger and the space you're provided with. You will move your character with your mouse and fire bullets by clicking the mouse. You will be able to navigate your "base" and have to defend it before the enemies get to it.

The overall goal of this project is to provide a competent and understandable flash game, hopefully with its own personality regardless of its obvious inspiration.
